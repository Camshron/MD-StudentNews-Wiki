# Understanding C,A, and P programs for residency match

Match on My Mind Preliminary Match Residency programs come in 3 main training types. There are C, A, and P programs. 

- Categorical (C) programs provide full training for a specialty and start this coming June 2026. 
- Advanced (A) programs begin in June of 2027 and require the matched applicant to complete at least one year of other training before starting. 
- Preliminary (P) programs are a one-year training experience that begins in July 2026. The most common preliminary programs are Preliminary Medicine, Preliminary Surgery, and a rotating Transitional Year (TY). 

Many specialties offer both C and A positions in the Match.Students who apply to Advanced programs must also apply to Preliminary programs.

You may also notice programs with a Reserved (R) designation. These are designed for applicants who have already completed at least 1 year of residency training and are not open to students. 

For a full residency training program course, you will be applying to C and/or A+P program types.

For more info, see this NRMP video about program types. 

## Applying to Preliminary programs 

You can usually use the same ERAS application, including the personal statement and LORs, from your primary specialty Match. You do not need a separate personal statement or letters for the preliminary programs. 

Very few Preliminary Medicine years will require the IM SEL (standardized evaluation letter) as one of your LORs. Be sure to check the individual program website (and see the upcoming Match on My Mind for more information about the standardized and Chair letters!). 

## Key advice for applicants

Some of the most competitive residency programs require applicants to complete a Preliminary year. You will be competing with other highly qualified applicants for positions!
To set yourself up for success, you will need to apply to, and interview with numerous preliminary or transitional programs. 

Please keep these important facts in mind when applying to programs. Successful students apply to an average of 16 programs and interview at 8 or more.
